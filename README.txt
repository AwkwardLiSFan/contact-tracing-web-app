Extra information regarding the WDC Project (Group 69):

a) Database:
-> We start off with users, venue managers and a health official (admin) (we need at least 1 in order to add more health officials to the app).
-> As a security measure, passwords are encrypted using bcrypt()

b) Use sql_start for starting the sql server and npm start to start the express server; following this, the website can be launched through the web server option.
